User Story 1
As a user I would like to be able to save my bookmarks and be able to see them in a list.


Connect to psql
Create the database using the psql command CREATE DATABASE bookmark_manager;
Connect to the database using the pqsl command \c bookmark_manager;
Run the query we have saved in the file 01_create_bookmarks_table.sql
